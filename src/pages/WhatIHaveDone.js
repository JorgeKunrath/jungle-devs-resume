        This job was my 101 to programing. I learned to setup a entire site using a blank WordPress
        theme. A looot of CSS ("A Complete Guide to Flexbox" was a fixed page). And a few uses of
        copied JS and PHP <del>that took me days to figure out how to use then properly</del> just
        worked.

        Where all the magic happened. I learned so much in my time in this company. HTML, CSS, JS,
        WordPress, React, Node, Next.js... but mostly important: programing concepts and good
        practices. I had to deal for the first time with legacy code and services/sites that already
        was in production. One big achievement was to migrate a couple of WordPress sites that was
        slow and very hard to maintain to a JAM Stack structure composed by Strapi as our CMS and
        Next.js that generate the pages. New features now can be delievered in matter of minutes and
        other people of the company can add/edit contents in a more resilient and fast way.

        A very intense project made for "ProgramaÃ§Ã£o para Web" class at UFSC. We had a month to make
        a entire app following a briefing, for a real state business. We decided to use React and
        Firebase as our stack. God, the excruciating pain to understand a few concepts of Firebase!
        (or maybe of database modeling ðŸ¤” ). Anyway, today I love it, very easy to use xP
