          This one was my 101 to programming. I learned to setup an entire site using a blank
          WordPress theme as base. A lot of CSS ("A Complete Guide to Flexbox" page was a constant
          visit for me), and a few uses of copied JS and PHP that{' '}

          Where all the magic happened. I learned so much in my time in this company. HTML, CSS, JS,
          WordPress, React, Node, Next.js... but most important: programming concepts and good
          practices.

          <br />I had to deal for the first time with legacy code and services/sites that already
          were in production. One big achievement was to move a couple of WordPress sites (that were
          slow and very hard to maintain) to a JAM Stack structure composed by Strapi as our CMS,
          and Next.js for theming. New features now can be delievered in a matter of minutes, and
          other people of the company can add/edit content faster and with less effort.

          , while following a set of predefined features. We decided to use React and Firebase as
          our stack. God, it was excruciating to understand a few concepts of Firebase! (or maybe of
          database modeling ü§î). But after this first rocky start, Firebase actually got a place in
          my heart. Now I'm more confident, and I've made another app with it:{' '}
